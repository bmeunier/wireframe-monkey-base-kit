Wireframe Monkey Base Kit
=========================

Lately, beautiful blueprint style wireframes have been catching my eye. I really like the feeling and visual aesthetics of this style of wireframe. This is a set of shapes for making blueprint wireframes in OmniGraffle version 5.x (Mac OS X). It consists of most basic elements I'm using everyday.
